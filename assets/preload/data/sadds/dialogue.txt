:bf0/2:Hello! Just a quick tutorial
:bf0:When you see only a strum and the orange effect...
:bf0:Don't press keys when there isn't any note. It will damage you
:bf0/3:Also, avoid black notes, they will damage you if you hit them
:bf0:Hitting the red flame notes (you know which ones) will result into a gameover
:bf0:I wish you best luck and i hope I can talk to you again
:bf0:See ya!
